# Sales Performance Dashboard

A resume‑ready project demonstrating SQL + Python analysis and a Tableau/Power BI dashboard over **~10 k transactions across four regions**.  
Use this repository to showcase your end‑to‑end ability to clean data, model metrics, and build polished visualizations that highlight business insights.  
Everything runs fully locally (SQLite) so recruiters can reproduce all metrics and visuals without external dependencies.

## 🧭 Project Goals
- Clean and model transaction data
- Identify revenue leakage (e.g., loss-making SKUs/regions, discount issues)
- Surface seasonal patterns and category performance
- Publish an interactive dashboard with clear KPIs

## 🖼️ Sample visualization
To give recruiters a sense of the kinds of insights you can surface, the repository includes a simple bar chart illustrating comparative sales performance across four categories/regions. Replace this image with snippets or exports from your own dashboard (e.g. screenshots from Tableau or Power BI).

## 🗃️ Data (example schema)
- **transactions.csv**: `order_id, order_date, sku, region, qty, unit_price, discount, channel`
- **products.csv**: `sku, product_name, category, sub_category`
- **regions.csv**: `region, manager, currency`

> Use any public dataset or generate a synthetic one. Keep ~10–50k rows for realism.

## ⚙️ Quickstart
1) Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2) (Optional) Build a local SQLite DB from CSVs:
```bash
python src/build_sqlite.py
```
3) Explore the data:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_and_Leakage.ipynb
```
4) Export curated tables to `data/processed/` for dashboarding.
5) Build your dashboard in Tableau/Power BI and export to `dashboards/`.

## 🔍 Analysis Outline
- **KPI set**: Revenue, Margin, AOV, Units, Discount %, Return Rate (if available)
- **Leakage checks**:
  - SKUs/regions with high discount, low margin (if COGS exists), or negative trends
  - Excessive discounting on specific SKUs or channels
  - Stockouts or missing SKUs (if data available)
- **Seasonality**: Monthly revenue trend, category seasonality
- **Segmentation**: Top N products/regions, Pareto 80/20

## 📊 Dashboard (suggested pages)
1. **Executive Overview** — Revenue, Margin, Growth vs. prior period
2. **Products & Categories** — Top/Bottom SKUs, revenue leakage table
3. **Regions** — Heatmap by region/category
4. **Time** — Seasonality and YoY/MoM trend

## 🧪 Reproducibility
A minimal CI workflow (GitHub Actions) is included to lint and run a smoke test so recruiters can see the repo is healthy.

## 🗺️ Deliverables for your resume
- “Built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing **10k+ transactions across four regions**; identified SKUs causing revenue leakage and surfacing seasonal patterns; recommended actions projected to lift revenue by **10%** and improve sales forecasting accuracy.”
